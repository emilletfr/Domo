<br>
## Wifi Modules
Role
- Get informations from sensors (indoor temperature/humidity, bed occupancy)
- Command actuators (boiler pomp, boiler heater, open/close rollers shutters)

Hardware part is composed of [NodeMcu](http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html) module, Temperature/Humidity sensor, Relays, PCB, USB power supply, Casing.
<br>
Firmware part for NodeMcu module is written in LUA
## Local Server
Role
- Emulate iOS HomeKit API
- Compute data from sensors, services (Sunrise time, Sunset time, Outdoor temperature), HomeKit service
- Command actuators in consequence

Infrastructure is a x86-64 architecture system which runs Ubuntu with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and... that's all! 
Docker's magic operate in such a way that the rest of stack components are Docker images.
### Vapor Stack
Docker container that runs [Ubuntu/Swift image](https://hub.docker.com/r/swiftdocker/swift/) and Vapor powered Server image.
### Portainer Stack
Docker container that runs [Portainer](http://portainer.io) in order to ease Docker management.
### Homebridge Stack
Container that runs (in one image) : Debian, Node.js, Homebridge and homebridge-httpeverything plugin.
